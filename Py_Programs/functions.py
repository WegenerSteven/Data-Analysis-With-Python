#A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused throughout your program. 
# Think of it like a recipe: you define the steps once, then call it whenever you need it. 
# In Python, you define functions with the def keyword, and they can take inputs (parameters), process them, and return results.
#Why Use Functions in Data Science?
#Reusability: Write once, use multiple times (e.g., a function to clean data).
#Modularity: Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
#Readability: Descriptive function names (e.g., calculate_mean) make code self-explanatory.
#Debugging: Isolate errors to specific functions rather than sprawling scripts.

#def: Keyword to define a function.
#function_name: Name of the function (use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores, e.g., calculate_mean).
#parameters: Inputs (optional; can have none or many).
#return: Sends a result back to the caller (optional; if omitted, the function returns None).

def say_hello():
    print("Hello, Data Scientist!")
say_hello()
#Functions with Parameters
#Parameters allow you to pass data into a function to process. You can have as many parameters as needed, and they act like variables inside the function.
def square(number):
    result = number ** 2
    return result
# Call the function
value = 5
squared_value = square(value)
print(f"Square of {value} is {squared_value}")
