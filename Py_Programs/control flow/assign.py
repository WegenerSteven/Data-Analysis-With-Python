'''### **Conditional Statements:**  
1. Write a Python program that takes a number as input and prints:  
   - `"Positive"` if the number is greater than 0.  
   - `"Negative"` if the number is less than 0.  
   - `"Zero"` if the number is 0.  

2. Given a dataset of student scores stored in a dictionary:  
   ```python
   student_scores = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 72, "Charlie": 90, "David": 65}
   ```
   Write a program that categorizes students as:  
   - `"Excellent"` (score ≥ 85)  
   - `"Good"` (70 ≤ score < 85)  
   - `"Needs Improvement"` (score < 70)  

### **Loops (For & While):**  
3. Write a Python program that calculates the **average of a list of numbers** using a `for` loop:  
   ```python
   numbers = [12, 45, 67, 89, 23, 56, 78]
   ```  

4. Given a dataset of temperatures in Celsius, write a program that converts them to Fahrenheit and prints only the temperatures above **80°F**:  
   ```python
   temperatures_celsius = [22, 30, 27, 35, 40, 18, 25]  
   ```  
   (Use the formula: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`)  

### **Break and Continue:**  
5. Write a program that finds the **first even number** in a list using a `for` loop and **stops searching** when it finds one (`break` statement):  
   ```python
   numbers = [13, 15, 19, 22, 29, 31]
   ```  

6. Given a list of product prices, write a program that **skips any prices that are less than 100** and prints only the valid ones (`continue` statement):  
   ```python
   product_prices = [250, 50, 120, 90, 300, 75, 400]'''
